Try to leave the arm in the rest postion, with the black switch turned off
(no lights on the servos of joints 4-5-6, and the USB to the Pololu Micro
Maestro USB cable unplugged at the Raspberry Pi (this is the USB cable
that comes out of the upper arm pipe).

// rest position
angles_d[ 4 ] = 600;
angles_d[ 5 ] = 600;
angles_d[ 6 ] = 500;

// elbow straight up, forearm horizontal
angles_d[ 4 ] = 500;
angles_d[ 5 ] = 513;
angles_d[ 6 ] = 500;

// straight up (roughly)
angles_d[ 4 ] = 167;
angles_d[ 5 ] = 513;
angles_d[ 6 ] = 500;
